# Halite-ML-starter-bot

After you've installed python 3.5, numpy, tensorflow, keras and h5py, ~~download and unzip hmate9's replay cache~~ (the Dropbox cache doesn't work anymore, see hvaara's solution: https://github.com/brianvanleeuwen/Halite-ML-starter-bot/issues/9):


Run the bot on to mimic the winner of each replay:
```
python train_bot.py ./replays
```

Add hlt.py, networking.py, model.h5, LANGUAGE, and MyBot.py to MyBot.zip and submit to [halite.io](https://halite.io)
