# Halite-ML-starter-bot

After you've installed python 3.5, numpy, tensorflow, keras and h5py, download and unzip hmate9's replay cache:
```
wget https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/uq8peg023a5vnkj/replays.zip?dl=0
unzip replays.zip?dl=0
```

Run the bot on to mimic the winner of each replay:
```
python train_bot.py ./replays
```

Add hlt.py, networking.py, model.h5, and MyBot.py to MyBot.zip and submit to [halite.io](https://halite.io)
